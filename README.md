# Capstone-Project-HR-Analytics

This project is about looking into those reasons by exploring the various factors. This would help the HR to intervene on time and handle the situation in a better way so as to prevent attrition. While this model can be routinely run to identify employees who are most likely to quit, the key driver of success would be the human element of reaching out the employee, understanding the current situation of the employee and taking action to remedy controllable factors that can prevent attrition of the employee.
